## Project Directory
1. **[project1-linux-commands](https://github.com/B-Akapo/Darey.io/tree/main/project1-linux-commands):** - In this initial project, I focused on elevating my command-line interface (CLI) skills, delving into the world of terminal commands, and learning efficient navigation within this environment. Take a look to explore the fundamental commands that have become the building blocks of my terminal proficiency.

2. **[project2-git](https://github.com/B-Akapo/Darey.io/tree/main/project2-git):** - In this introductory project, I've immersed myself in the world of Gitâ€”a powerful version control system. I've dived into the basics, from initializing repositories and making commits to exploring branches and collaborating with others. This project is my gateway to understanding version control and mastering the essential commands that form the foundation of Git proficiency.

3. **[project3-deploying_A_LAMP_Application](https://github.com/B-Akapo/Darey.io/tree/main/project3-deploying_A_LAMP_Application):** - In this hands-on project, I'm delving into the realm of cloud computing by deploying a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack application on Amazon Web Services (AWS). I'm navigating through the process of setting up a virtual server on AWS, configuring Linux, installing Apache as the web server, integrating MySQL for database management, and implementing PHP for dynamic web content. This project serves as my foundational journey into cloud deployment, allowing me to comprehend the infrastructure as code and grasp the fundamental concepts of provisioning resources in a cloud environment. From securing the server to optimizing performance, I'm exploring the intricacies of hosting a functional web application while learning to leverage AWS services efficiently.

4. **[project4-deploying-LEMP-Application](https://github.com/B-Akapo/Darey.io/tree/main/project4-deploying-LEMP-Application):** - In this hands-on project, I'm immersing myself in the realm of cloud deployment by setting up a LEMP (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, PHP) stack application on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Navigating through the complexities of cloud infrastructure, I'm configuring a virtual server on AWS with Linux, implementing Nginx as the web server, integrating MySQL for efficient database management, and harnessing PHP for dynamic web content generation. This project serves as my foundational journey into cloud deployment, enabling me to comprehend infrastructure-as-code principles and grasp the essential concepts of provisioning resources within a cloud environment. From fortifying server security to optimizing application performance, I'm exploring the nuances of hosting a robust web application while effectively leveraging AWS services.

5. **[project5-shell-scripting](https://github.com/B-Akapo/Darey.io/tree/main/project5-shell-scripting):** - In this hands-on project, I'm diving into the world of shell scripting to automate various tasks and manage system functionalities. As I explore the vast landscape of shell scripting, I'm gaining a thorough understanding of building reliable, error-resistant scripts. From handling permissions to creating user-friendly interfaces and configuring intricate system setups, this project serves as a stepping stone into the world of automation and efficient system management.

6. **[project6-client-server-architecture](https://github.com/B-Akapo/Darey.io/tree/main/project6-client-server-architecture):** - In this project, my focus was mastering client-server communication through MySQL RDBMS. I practiced and refined strategies for efficient data exchange, ensuring smooth interactions between clients and servers. Working with MySQL, I gained valuable insights into optimizing this communication, enhancing system reliability, and laying the foundation for seamless data handling in client-server setups

7. **[project7-loadbalancing-nginx](https://github.com/B-Akapo/Darey.io/tree/main/project7-loadbalancing-nginx):** - In this project I practiced Nginx load balancing, optimizing client-server interactions. Implementing Nginx, I fine-tuned load distribution, ensuring smooth communication between clients and servers. This sharpened my skills in managing high traffic, enhancing system reliability, and refining client-server architectures for efficient data handling.

8. **[project8-automating-loadbalancing](https://github.com/B-Akapo/Darey.io/tree/main/project8-automating-loadbalancing):** - In this project I employed shell scripting to automate the load balancing process. By scripting directly in the shell, I aimed to streamline and simplify the configuration of load balancing. This helped in faster and more consistent deployment, enabling dynamic adjustments to handle changing traffic patterns or server loads.
