# Introduction to Linux and Its Commands
Linux is an open-source operating system kernel that serves as the foundation for various Unix-like operating systems. Known for its stability, security, and flexibility, Linux has become a popular choice for servers, embedded systems, and desktop environments.

Linux commands are essential tools for interacting with the operating system. They provide users with the ability to navigate the file system, manage processes, configure system settings, and perform a wide range of tasks. Understanding Linux commands is crucial for both beginners and experienced users, as it empowers efficient system administration and customization. This project will cover fundamental commands to help users navigate and harness the power of Linux effectively.

# File Manipulation

## 1. sudo command
The `sudo` command in Linux allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser or another user, as specified by the security policy. It is commonly used to perform administrative tasks that require elevated privileges. for example: `sudo apt upgrade`

## 4. ls command
The `ls` command in Linux is used to list the files and directories in the current working directory. The `ls` command default is to list all the files and subdirectories within a directory. However there are somany options you can attach to `ls`. For example:
- `ls -a`: list all the files including the hidden files
- `ls -l`: list all the file information including the permissions dates and owner
- To learn more about the options use `man ls` or `info ls`

![Alt Text](https://github.com/B-Akapo/Darey.io/blob/main/project1-linux-commands/images/diff-command.png)

# File Permissions and Ownership

## 20. tar command
The tar command in Linux is used to create, view, extract, or manipulate tar archives, which are collections of files and directories bundled together into a single file. to create a **.tar** file, use `tar -cvf archive.tar files/directories`. To extract the files use `tar -xvf archive.tar`

![Alt Text](https://github.com/B-Akapo/Darey.io/blob/main/project1-linux-commands/images/tar-command.png)

## 21. chmod command
The `chmod` command in Linux is used to change the permissions (read, write, execute) of files and directories.It uses symbolic or numeric representation to modify permissions, allowing users to control who can read, write, and execute files and directories.

![Alt Text](https://github.com/B-Akapo/Darey.io/blob/main/project1-linux-commands/images/chmod-command.png)

## 22. chown command
The `chown` command in Linux is used to change the ownership of files and directories. For example:

- To change ownership of a file or directory use `chown newowner filename/directoryname`. Replace `newowner` with the new owner's username or user ID and filename/directoryname with the target file or directory.

`chown user1 file.txt` changes the owner of the file `file.txt` to `user1`.

## 23. jobs command
The `jobs` command in Unix-like operating systems is used to list the current jobs running in the background or suspended in the current shell session.

`# List current jobs
jobs`

Running `jobs` displays a list of all background jobs spawned from the current shell session, along with their job IDs and status information. This command is particularly useful when multiple processes are running concurrently in the background, allowing users to monitor and manage them.

## 24. kill command
The `kill` command in Linux is used to terminate processes by sending a signal to a specified process ID (PID) or job.

**Code snippet example:**
```
# Terminate a process by PID
kill PID

# Forcefully terminate a process by PID
kill -9 PID
```

Replace PID with the process ID of the target process.

- The first example (kill PID) sends the default **SIGTERM** signal to the specified process, allowing it to perform cleanup before termination.
- The second example (kill -9 PID) sends the **SIGKILL** signal, forcibly terminating the specified process without allowing it to perform any cleanup tasks. Use this cautiously as it immediately ends the process.

`kill` provides a means to manage running processes by stopping or ending them based on their process IDs.


## 25. ping command
The `ping` command in Linux is used to test network connectivity by sending ICMP echo request packets to a target host and waiting for replies. For example `ping google.com`

## 26. weget command
The `wget` command in Linux is used to retrieve files from the internet via various protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more.

![Alt Text](https://github.com/B-Akapo/Darey.io/blob/main/project1-linux-commands/images/weget-command.png)

**Note:** 
- To download a zipped file from a specified url use `wget https://example.com/file.zip`
- `wget -O output_file https://example.com/file` downloads the file from the URL and saves it with the specified name output_file.

## 27. uname command
The `uname` command in Linux is used to display system information, including the system name, kernel version, hardware architecture, and more.

![Alt Text](https://github.com/B-Akapo/Darey.io/blob/main/project1-linux-commands/images/uname-command.png)

Some options to use for `uname` are:
- `uname -a` provides comprehensive system information, including the kernel name, network node hostname, kernel release, kernel version, machine hardware name, and the operating system
- `uname -s` is used to display the operating system name
- is used to display the network node hostname of the system. It retrieves and displays the name assigned to the system on the network.

## 28. top command
The `top` command in Linux is used to display system processes in real-time, providing a dynamic, interactive view of system resource usage. Running `top` in the terminal presents a live, updating list of processes, showing information such as CPU usage, memory usage, process IDs (PIDs), running time, and more. It's a powerful tool for monitoring system performance and identifying resource-intensive processes.

## 29. history command
The `history` command in Linux is used to display a list of previously executed commands in the current shell session.

![Alt Text](https://github.com/B-Akapo/Darey.io/blob/main/project1-linux-commands/images/history-command.png)

## 30. man command
The `man` command in Linux is used to display the manual pages (documentation) for various commands and functionalities within the system. For example `man ls` will give you the manual for the `ls` command

![Alt Text](https://github.com/B-Akapo/Darey.io/blob/main/project1-linux-commands/images/man-command.png)

## 31. echo command
The `echo` command in Linux is used to display text or variables to the terminal or standard output.

![Alt Text](https://github.com/B-Akapo/Darey.io/blob/main/project1-linux-commands/images/echo-command1.png)

`echo` can also be used to create a new file like the `touch` commmand. However, the files created by `echo` are not empty. that makes it different from `touch`. To use te echo command type `echo "<string>" > filename`. Becareful though, using echo again on the same file will overwrite what you previously saved. To avoid this use `echo "<string>" >> filename`. `>>` appends the new content to the last line instead of overwriting the whole file.

## 32. echo command
The `zip` command in Linux is used to compress files into a ZIP archive format. While `unzip` is used to extract files from a ZIP archive.

![Alt Text](https://github.com/B-Akapo/Darey.io/blob/main/project1-linux-commands/images/zip-unzip-command.png)

## 33. hostname command
The `hostname` command in Linux is used to display or set the system's hostname.

![Alt Text](https://github.com/B-Akapo/Darey.io/blob/main/project1-linux-commands/images/hostname-command.png)

## 34. useradd, userdel command
The `useradd` command in Linux is used to add new user accounts to the system. While `userdel` command is used to delete user accounts from the system.

I'd advice you to check the list of users first. you cando this using `cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd`

![Alt Text](https://github.com/B-Akapo/Darey.io/blob/main/project1-linux-commands/images/useradd-command1.png)

In the screenshot you can see my useer name `bunmi`. To add a new user run the command `useradd <username>` (replace username with the desired name). if you are not running the command as a root user then you will need to use `sudo useradd <username>`.

Once you have created the new user you can run `cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd` to see the new added user. In the screenshot below you can see i added `guest` as the new user. 

![Alt Text](https://github.com/B-Akapo/Darey.io/blob/main/project1-linux-commands/images/useradd-command2.png)

To delete and existing user is easy. Simply run the command `userdel <username>`. If you aren't running the command as a root user, then you will need to run `sudo userdel <username>`. By default, the `userdel` command will remove the user from the system account files, deleting all entries that refer to the username. However, it will not delete the user's home directory or mail spool. If you want to remove the user's home directory and mail spool as well, you can use `sudo userdel -r <username>`
