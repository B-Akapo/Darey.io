# Introduction to Linux and Its Commands
Linux is an open-source operating system kernel that serves as the foundation for various Unix-like operating systems. Known for its stability, security, and flexibility, Linux has become a popular choice for servers, embedded systems, and desktop environments.

Linux commands are essential tools for interacting with the operating system. They provide users with the ability to navigate the file system, manage processes, configure system settings, and perform a wide range of tasks. Understanding Linux commands is crucial for both beginners and experienced users, as it empowers efficient system administration and customization. This project will cover fundamental commands to help users navigate and harness the power of Linux effectively.

## 1. sudo command
The `sudo` command in Linux allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser or another user, as specified by the security policy. It is commonly used to perform administrative tasks that require elevated privileges. for example: `sudo apt upgrade`
