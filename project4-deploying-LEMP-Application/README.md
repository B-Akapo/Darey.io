# Introduction to LEMP Stack
The LEMP stack stands as a powerful and widely-used infrastructure for web development and hosting. It's comprised of four key components:

- **Linux:** This open-source operating system forms the foundational layer of the stack, providing stability and security.
- **Nginx (pronounced as "Engine X"):** Serving as the web server, Nginx efficiently handles HTTP requests, making it a high-performance alternative to Apache.
- **MySQL (or MariaDB):** A robust relational database management system that manages and organizes structured data for applications.
- **PHP:** A popular server-side scripting language enabling dynamic content generation, interaction with databases, and the creation of web-based applications.

The combination of Linux, Nginx, MySQL, and PHP forms a robust environment for deploying scalable and high-performance web applications. Each component contributes uniquely to the stack, empowering developers with flexibility, security, and efficiency in web development and deployment.

# Getting Started With AWS
- **AWS Account:** Setting up an AWS account is actually vry easy. Everything you need to know can be found [here](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)
- **Setting Up an EC2 Instance: **I have a detailed step-by-step guide on how to set-up your EC2 instance on AWS. You can use [this docmentation](https://github.com/B-Akapo/Darey.io/tree/main/project3-deploying_A_LAMP_Application#setting-up-an-ec2-instance) to quickly set yours up before coming back her to continue
- **Connecting To Your EC2 Instace:** In order to work remotely and effectively,you will need to connect your local machine to your EC2 instance. It is quite easy. I have a detailed step-by-step guide [here](https://github.com/B-Akapo/Darey.io/tree/main/project3-deploying_A_LAMP_Application#connecting-to-your-ec2-instance-from-your-local-machine) on how to do that. DO that there and then we can continue with setting up our stack.
